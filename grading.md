## Unit Project Overview
DSI requires students to complete **four** unit projects. For each project, we provide a color coded guide for each section which indicates the relative level of difficulty for that section. These colored gears define different types of problems. You can find these in the jupyter notebook starter-code for each project. 

### GA Grading Guidelines
Project questions are organized by **Challenge** Level. Students must answer all **Required** questions on any given project, which ask stuednts to demonstrate competencies that align with overall **Project Requirements.** Instructors will review student submissions and  use the GA **Rubric** to score performance for each requirement.

Read below for more information on how we categorize project challenges, as well as grade project submissions:

## Challenge Levels

### Green: "Required" Project Sections

Sections marked with a green gear icon are the **required** questions in a project. These are the questions designed to be reasonably finished within the time given for each project. 

Students must prioritize these sections and complete them in order to receive credit for their submission. Do not move on to complete more advanced problems **without first completing all required sections!** 

- Students will be given feedback on all required Green challenge questions.

### Blue: "Bonus" Sections

Sections marked with a blue gear icon are optional "bonus" questions. These are typically extensions to the required material. In general, blue sections will be more difficult than required sections, asking students to apply advanced concepts or go beyond their in-class work.

- We recommend that students try their hand at bonus questions when possible, but **students should not expect individual feedback** on these attempts. Bonus section content will typically be covered as a group in-class, when applicable.

### Gold: "Challenge" Sections

Sections marked with a gold gear icon are optional "challenge" questions, representing stretch goals well beyond the scope of the project. These sections are designed to test student comprehenion of the material at an advanced level. 

Gold sections will frequently lack any single "correct" answer, and may draw more heavily upon outside material not covered in class (although relevant to the concepts at hand).

- Most students will not be able to easily answer challenge questions, which frequently represent concepts outside the scope of this course. Instructors will typically be unable to provide direct feedback on challenge sections, so students should **not** expect individual guidance.
- However, advanced students should feel free to attempt these as long as they are willing to explain and demo their work to the class!

## Grading Overview

Below, we briefly review what to grade when working on unit projects. For additional examples and advice on providing quality feedback during student projects, [check out the following advice and examples from prior instructors](./instructor-facing-feedback-guide.md).

### Requirements

Instructors should review the "Requirements" for each unit project in order to assess the specific skills & competencies that students are expected to demonstrate. For example, Project 1 asks students to demonstrate:

  - Command of basic Python data structures
  - Command of basic Python syntax and control log
  - Comfort with calculating basic descriptive statistics

Instructors should apply the rubric to a student's performance on each requirement, then follow up with qualitative feedback.

### Rubric

_(Note: precise grading rubric, scoring metric and feedback mechanism are subject to change at the instructors' discretion.)_

For all projects, requirements should be evaluated on a simple 4 point scale (0, 1, 2 or 3). 

Score | Expectations
:----- | :------------
**0** | _Does not meet expectations. Try again._
**1** | _Approaching expectations. Getting there..._
**2** | _Meets expecations. Great job._
**3** | _Surpasses expectations. Brilliant!_
